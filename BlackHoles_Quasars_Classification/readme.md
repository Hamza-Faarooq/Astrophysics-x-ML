   # Black Holes and Quasars Classification with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project involves generating synthetic data for black holes and quasars, preprocessing the data, training a machine learning model to classify the objects, and evaluating the model's performance. The project aims to achieve an accuracy of over 95% using a RandomForestClassifier.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Generation**: Create a synthetic dataset with 1 million entries.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the data to understand distributions and relationships.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features for the model.
5. **Model Selection and Training**: Train a RandomForestClassifier.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
7. **Visualization**: Visualize the results for better interpretation.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
